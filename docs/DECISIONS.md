# Decisions

This append-only record holds choices that a future session might otherwise re-litigate.

## D-001 Static site with no project dependencies  (2026-10-17, status: accepted)

**Context:** The product must be browser-based, portable, and zero dependency.

**Decision:** Ship authored HTML, CSS, JavaScript modules, and LOLCODE directly. Use no package manager, bundler, framework, remote font, CDN asset, analytics service, or server runtime.

**Alternatives:** A framework starter would speed common UI work but add a build and dependency chain. A desktop wrapper would weaken the immediate browser-toy quality.

**Consequences:** The app needs a static HTTP origin and must implement its own narrow interpreter. Browser-native APIs define the compatibility floor.

## D-002 Execute a purpose-built LOLCODE subset in the browser  (2026-10-17, status: accepted)

**Context:** Standard LOLCODE has no browser graphics or Web Audio surface, while LOLCODE must retain a causal role in the product.

**Decision:** `src/oracle.lol` owns generative score arithmetic. `src/lolcode.mjs` implements only the 1.2 constructs required by that spell and fails on all unsupported statements.

**Alternatives:** Translating LOLCODE by hand into JavaScript would make it decorative. Shipping a compiled full interpreter would increase size and build complexity. Calling a server-side interpreter would violate the local zero-dependency boundary.

**Consequences:** Compatibility claims remain narrow. Every new language construct requires interpreter tests before the spell can use it.

## D-003 Phrase determinism is a product contract  (2026-10-17, status: accepted)

**Context:** A repeatable creature gives the toy memory-like character without storing user data.

**Decision:** Normalize each phrase with NFKC, trim it, case-fold with the fixed `en-US` locale, hash it with 32-bit FNV-1a, and pass that seed to the spell. The same normalized phrase must produce the same score.

**Alternatives:** Fresh randomness offers novelty but erases identity. Persisted random results require storage and migration rules.

**Consequences:** Changes to normalization, hashing, score formulas, name tables, or scale mapping are compatibility changes and require an explicit superseding decision.

## D-004 One score drives a ten-second paired omen  (2026-10-17, status: superseded by D-005)

**Context:** Sound and image need shared causality, and a browser toy benefits from a bounded encounter.

**Decision:** The score controls waveform, root, pulse, eight melodic steps, hue, symmetry, twist, bloom, eyes, and name. Web Audio plays for ten seconds while the Canvas creature continues as a quiet visual presence.

**Alternatives:** Endless playback risks fatigue. A generic audio analyser would make the image react to volume without sharing compositional structure.

**Consequences:** Replay repeats the same omen. Future length or parameter changes must preserve the shared-score invariant.

## D-005 Continuous loops and expanded creature grammar  (2026-10-17, status: accepted)

**Context:** The first hands-on review found that ten seconds ended too quickly and narrow visual, musical, and naming ranges made repeats visible.

**Decision:** Keep an omen sounding until it is muted, replaced, restarted, or the page closes. Expand the LOLCODE score to twelve melodic steps, eight scales, six rhythms, six voice stacks, ten shape families, 65 sizes, eight palette grammars, broader motion and form ranges, and a six-template ceremonial name grammar.

**Alternatives:** A longer fixed duration still ends without user intent. Fresh randomness would create variety at the cost of deterministic identity. Cosmetic host-side variation would weaken LOLCODE's causal role.

**Consequences:** Phrase outputs from the initial prototype intentionally change under this pre-release schema expansion. Continuous audio increases the importance of visible mute behavior and clean replacement scheduling. The shared-score and phrase-determinism invariants remain intact for the new schema.

## Open questions
