# Archived Session Log

Active handoff state and the latest ten sessions live in [../HANDOFF.md](../HANDOFF.md).

### Session 1: 2026-10-17: first summoning

**Contributor:** Codex with maintainer direction

**Goal:** Specify and prototype a whimsical zero-dependency browser app in LOLCODE.

**Done:** P1-01, P1-02, P2-01, P2-02, P2-03

**Changed:** Created the project specification, interpreter, spell, score boundary, interface, animation, audio instrument, and tests.

**Decisions:** D-001 through D-004

**Verified:** Nine Node checks passed; documentation checker reported 0 errors and 0 warnings.

**Not verified:** Real browser visuals, listening quality, mobile devices, Firefox, Safari, and assistive technology.

**Problems:** Standard LOLCODE lacks browser media APIs; D-002 assigns score composition to LOLCODE and instrument duties to a narrow host.

**Left undone:** P3, P4, P5, and P6 roadmap items.

**Next session should start with:** P4-01.

### Session 2: 2026-10-17: the omen keeps humming

**Contributor:** Codex with maintainer direction

**Goal:** Loop sound continuously and expand repeated musical, visual, and naming outcomes.

**Done:** P5-01; expanded P2-02 behavior

**Changed:** Added a continuous look-ahead audio scheduler, twelve-note phrases, eight scales, six rhythms and voice stacks, ten shape families, larger visual ranges, and six ceremonial name templates with larger vocabularies.

**Decisions:** D-005 supersedes the fixed-duration part of D-004.

**Verified:** Eleven Node checks passed; documentation checker and whitespace review passed.

**Not verified:** Listening continuity, subjective mix, animation quality, and cross-browser behavior.

**Problems:** None at handoff update time.

### Session 3: 2026-10-17: eyes with opinions

**Contributor:** Codex with maintainer direction

**Goal:** Replace repeated stamped eyes with varied anatomy and expression.

**Done:** P5-02

**Changed:** Added eight eye silhouettes, eight iris treatments, eight pupil geometries, six layouts, eight gaze directions, size variation, and per-eye color shifts driven by new LOLCODE score fields.

**Decisions:** D-006

**Verified:** Eleven Node checks passed, including score ranges and 256-phrase coverage of every categorical eye variant; documentation checker reported 0 errors and 0 warnings.

**Not verified:** Subjective eye rendering, clipping, and legibility in real browsers.

**Problems:** None at handoff update time.

**Left undone:** P3, P4, and P6 roadmap items.

**Next session should start with:** P4-01.

### Session 4: 2026-10-17: impossible geometry with boundaries

**Contributor:** Codex with maintainer direction

**Goal:** Replace pulse-dominated blobs with complex self-contained forms that have their own kinetic movement.

**Done:** P5-03

**Changed:** Added five deterministic kinetic score fields, eight silhouette-flux grammars, and eight internal motion systems. The tesseract renderer rotates in four dimensions before two-stage perspective projection; every system is clipped to the currently deforming body. Reduced the shared beat pulse so it no longer dominates motion.

**Decisions:** D-007

**Verified:** Twelve Node checks passed, including 256-phrase categorical coverage and structural boundary containment; documentation checker reported 0 errors and 0 warnings.

**Not verified:** Subjective motion quality, frame rate, clipping, and legibility in real browsers.

**Problems:** None at handoff update time.

**Left undone:** P3, P4, and P6 roadmap items.

**Next session should start with:** P4-01.

### Session 5: 2026-10-17: no more macroblock heartbeat

**Contributor:** Codex with maintainer direction

**Goal:** Remove the glitchy, compression-artifact quality from sound-synchronous body movement.

**Done:** Incidental rendering fix; no roadmap item added.

**Changed:** Replaced the six-percent, eighth-power beat spike with a continuously differentiable 1.2% peak-to-peak sinusoidal scale envelope. Independent boundary flux and kinetic-core movement are unchanged.

**Decisions:** No new durable decision; this corrects the pulse treatment already defined by D-007.

**Verified:** Thirteen Node checks passed, including a regression marker for the smooth envelope; documentation checker reported 0 errors and 0 warnings.

**Not verified:** Subjective visual quality in a real browser remains P4-01.

**Problems:** None at handoff update time.

**Left undone:** P3, P4, and P6 roadmap items.

**Next session should start with:** P4-01.

### Session 6: 2026-10-17: let the geometry keep its footing

**Contributor:** Codex with maintainer direction

**Goal:** Remove the beat-periodic jitter still visible after smoothing the scale envelope.

**Done:** Incidental rendering correction; no roadmap item added.

**Changed:** Removed audio-pulse-driven Canvas scaling completely. Boundary flux, internal kinetic systems, eye behavior, and slow orbital drift are unchanged.

**Decisions:** D-008 supersedes the retained beat-scale portion of D-007.

**Verified:** Reviewed the supplied 3.25-second, 757×648 H.264 screencast frame by frame; hard vertical update bands coincide with whole-creature beat changes. Thirteen Node checks passed, including a regression check that the visual draw path does not consume `score.pulse`; documentation checker reported 0 errors and 0 warnings.

**Not verified:** A follow-up capture of the corrected renderer and cross-browser sensory review remain P4-01.

**Problems:** The first correction made the scale envelope mathematically smooth but did not prevent large synchronous repaints from reading as jitter.

**Left undone:** P3, P4, and P6 roadmap items.

**Next session should start with:** Re-record the same creature, then continue P4-01.

### Session 7: 2026-10-17: take the fog machine off the linework

**Contributor:** Codex with maintainer direction

**Goal:** Correct persistent animation judder without sacrificing kinetic motion or audio playback.

**Done:** Incidental Canvas performance fix; no roadmap item added.

**Changed:** Scoped the large silhouette shadow blur to the single body-fill pass and explicitly disabled shadow blur inside the kinetic renderer. Previously every internal line, ring, and eye inherited a blur as large as 62 pixels, multiplying per-frame compositing work.

**Decisions:** No new durable product decision; this corrects leaked Canvas state.

**Verified:** Fourteen Node checks passed, including a regression check that the body blur is restored before kinetic linework; the continuous audio scheduler marker still passes; documentation checker reported 0 errors and 0 warnings.

**Not verified:** Follow-up subjective motion and audio playback in the maintainer's browser remain P4-01.

**Problems:** The prior beat-decoupling change removed one synchronized repaint but did not address the underlying leaked blur cost. A page reload also stops the old audio context; playback requires a new Summon gesture under browser autoplay policy.

**Left undone:** P3, P4, and P6 roadmap items.

**Next session should start with:** Summon the same phrase after reload and record frame pacing; then continue P4-01.
